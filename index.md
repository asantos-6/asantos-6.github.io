Having been passionate all my life about music, I strive to combine that passion with my electrical and computer science background. My master's thesis was my first step in this journey: I developed a program that generates musical artifacts inspired by images. I also love teaching and helping others, which led me to tutor other students at a tutoring center in different university-level subjects (Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Signals and Systems, etc.) as well as having been a Graduate Teaching Assistant teaching Digital Systems at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST). I was lucky enough to have been awarded an Excellent Teacher award for my time as a TA :)

Currently, I am an Informatics Engineering Ph.D. candidate at Universidade de Coimbra (UC) with a research focus on Music Information Retrieval and Computational Creativity. In particular, I'm researching Percussive Timbre Transfer as part of my PhD thesis. 

I'm always open to discussing all things Music or Creative AI, feel free to reach out! :D
